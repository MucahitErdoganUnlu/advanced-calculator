# Advanced Calculator Introduction
Purpose of this project is to make a terminal calculator that can perform the expressions defined in the assignment file. The expressions are “+”, “*”, “-“, “&”, “|” operations and “xor”, “ls”, “rs”, “lr”, “rr”, “not” functions. Also, the calculator should consider the characters coming after “%” symbol as comment, thus, ignore them.

# Program Interface
Users shall open computer’s terminal by typing “terminal” in finder and clicking it. After that, user shall go to directory which includes main.c, htable.c, defs.h and Makefile files. These files shall be in the same directory and user shall go to that directory by using “cd” command.
•	Step-1: Go to correct directory.
•	Step-2: Run “make” command.
•	Step-3: Run “./advcalc” command.
•	Step-4: Write any expressions for calculation.
•	Step-5: Press <Ctrl-D> to terminate the program.

# Program Execution
After going to directory and running “make” and “./advcalc” commands on terminal one by one, write an assignment or an expression to be calculated and press “Enter”. Once you assign an identifier a value, it will be stored until the program is terminated. Even if you caused an error you may continue calculating without refreshing the terminal or using “make” command again.
